# StraightFace: Video-Chat Roulette Web App

## A video-chat app where 2 users are paired randomly and one of them must make the other one laugh built using Flask/SocketIO/WebRTC/FaceAPI.

StraightFace takes its own twist on modern video-chat roulette applications. Instead of just calling somone, the goal is to make your opponent laugh, or be the one trying to stay serious. It utilizes SocketIO to pair users, WebRTC to establish a video connection, and FaceAPI to detect if the user is smiling or laughing.

## Features

-**Random Pairing**: Users are randomly matched with another user for a one-on-one video call.

-**Video Calling**: The app utilizes WebRTC technology to enable real-time video and audio communication between the paired users.

-**Chat Functionality**: If the user does not posess a camera, they can use the chat feature to communicate.

-**Flask/SocketIO Backend**: Flask and Socket.IO are used to create the web server and handle real-time communication between clients.

-**Smile/Laugh Detection**: JavaScript FaceAPI is used for video processing and facial expression recognition to determine if the challenge is successfully met.
