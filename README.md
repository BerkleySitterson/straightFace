# StraightFace: Full Stack Video-Chat Web Application

## A video-chat web app where 2 users are paired randomly and one of them must make the other smile, built using Flask/SocketIO/WebRTC/FaceAPI.

- The backend is built using Flask which uses SocketIO to respond to real-time events during the video call.

- WebRTC is used to connect users with each other directly in the browser. Benefits of this include a more secure connection, higher quality voice/video feeds, compatibility, and performance.

- Real-time smile detection is achieved using face-api, an open source JavaScript API used to recognize facial expressions in the browser.

- Implemented salted password hashing to increase user security and authentication.

- The frontend is built using plain HTML and CSS.
